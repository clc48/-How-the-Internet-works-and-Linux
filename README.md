We use it daily but do we really comprehend how it works? Unfortunately most of us don't, so here is a simple tutorial explaining how the internet works!

#  IP ADDRESS
WHAT IS AN IP ADDRESS ?

The "IP" part of IP address stands for "Internet Protocol." The "address" part refers to a unique number that gets linked to all online activity you do...
somewhat like a return address on a letter you'd send out. (All this happens in milliseconds.)
Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet must have a unique address. Internet addresses are in the form
nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255.

# DNS
Now that we have a concept of what an Ip address is we must understand what is a DNS:
First of all, DNS is an acronym that stands for Domain Name System. DNS is an Internet service that translates domain names/hostnames to IP addresses (forward DNS) and IP addresses to
their associated domain names/hostnames (Reverse DNS) with the help of a DNS server.

**THINK OF A DNS AS A PHONE BOOK, THE IP ADRESS IS THE PHONE NUMBER AND THE DNS PROVIDES YOU WITH THE PERSON'S NAME, WHICH IS OF COURSE EASIER FOR US TO REMEMBER AND THEREFORE MORE USER FRIENDLY**

How DNS Works in 6 Easy Steps:

1.The user logs onto their Internet Service Provider (ISP) to use the Internet. 

2.The user opens up a web browser (Firefox, Chrome, Internet Explorer(if you are are living in prehistoric times), Safari, etc.) 
and types a URL into the address bar. For example, perhaps the user types in https://www.github.com/.

3.The computer then asks for the ISP’s DNS servers for the specific IP address for www.github.com

4.Once the DNS server that holds this specific IP address for www.github.com is found, the DNS server responds with the appropriate IP address and the user’s computer then gives this address to the user’s browser.

5.The browser opens a connection to the server using the IP address provided and retrieves the page from the site requested, in this case for www.github.com

6.The browser displays the requested page on the computer screen.


#DOMAIN NAMES AND TLD'S 
A domain name is simply the name assigned to an IP address. As we mentioned before, if the IP address is the phone number in a phonebook, the DNS is the phonebook itself therefore the tool we use to find it, and the Domain name would be the equivalent to the 
contact's name.
 
A domain name takes the form of two main elements. For example, the domain name Github.com consists of the website’s name (Github) and the domain name extension (.com). 
When a company (or a person) purchases a domain name, they’re able to specify which server that the domain name points to.
Every domain name has a suffix that indicates which top level domain (TLD) it belongs to.
Top-level domains serve as an instant way to understand what a website is about or where it's based.

For example, seeing a .edu address, like in www.njit.edu will immediately inform you that the material on the website is centered around education. 

There's also a side effect TLDs, which is that because there are several options, multiple websites can use the same name but be totally different sites or companies. Apart from the last bit where the TLD sits, the URLs might be identical.

For example, github.com is a website but github.org is another with the same name but different TLD, so they're actually completely different websites. 

It's for this reason that some companies will register multiple TLDs so that anyone going to the other, non-primary URLs, will still land on the company's website. For example, google.com is how you reach Google's website, but you can also get there through google.net. However, google.org is a totally different website.

There are only a limited number of such domains. Here are a few for example:

gov - Government agencies

edu - Educational institutions

org - Organizations (nonprofit)

com - commercial business

net - Network organizations

ca- Canada

Websites like godaddy.com allow the public to purchase Domain names as long as they are available. So if you are thinking of starting your own business or a blog you could have your own Domain name! (This is not an ad for godaddy i swear)
