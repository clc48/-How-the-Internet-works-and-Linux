#  IP ADDRESS
WHAT IS AN IP ADDRESS ?

The "IP" part of IP address stands for "Internet Protocol." The "address" part refers to a unique number that gets linked to all online activity you do...
somewhat like a return address on a letter you'd send out. (All this happens in milliseconds.)
Because the Internet is a global network of computers each computer connected to the Internet must have a unique address. Internet addresses are in the form
nnn.nnn.nnn.nnn where nnn must be a number from 0 - 255.
