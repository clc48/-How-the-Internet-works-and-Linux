Linux is a freely distributable version of Unix, originally developed by Linus Torvalds,
 who began work on Linux in 1991 as a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland.

 Inspired by Andrew Tanenbaum’s Minix operating system (another free Unix for PCs—albeit
 a very simple one), Linux began as a class project in which Linus wanted to build a simple
 Unix system that could run on a 386-based PC.
