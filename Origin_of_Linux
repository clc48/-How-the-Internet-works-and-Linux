Linux is a freely distributable version of Unix, originally developed by Linus Torvalds,
who began work on Linux in 1991 as a student at the University of Helsinki in Finland.
Inspired by Andrew Tanenbaumâ€™s Minix operating system Linux began as a class project in
which Linus wanted to build a simple Unix system that could run on a 386-based PC.
It was  developed as a multitasking system for minicomputers and mainframes in the
mid-1970s. It has since grown to become one of the most widely used operating systems anywhere

The Unix operating system found its beginnings in MULTICS, which stands for Multiplexed Operating and
Computing System. The MULTICS project began in the mid 1960s as a joint effort by General Electric,
Massachusetts Institute for Technology and Bell Laboratories. In 1969 Bell Laboratories pulled out of the project.
One of Bell Laboratories people involved in the project was Ken Thompson. He liked the potential MULTICS had,
but felt it was too complex and that the same thing could be done in simpler way. In 1969 he wrote the first
version of Unix, called UNICS. UNICS stood for Uniplexed Operating and Computing System. Although the operating
system has changed, the name stuck and was eventually shortened to Unix.

Ken Thompson teamed up with Dennis Ritchie, who wrote the first C compiler. In 1973 they rewrote the Unix
kernel in C. The following year a version of Unix known as the Fifth Edition was first licensed to universities.
The Seventh Edition, released in 1978, served as a dividing point for two divergent lines of Unix development.
These two branches are known as SVR4 (System V) and BSD.
